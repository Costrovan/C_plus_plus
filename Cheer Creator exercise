move forward by at least a yard you stay quiet and say "shh", and if they move forward 10 yards or less, you say "Ra!" fir every yard that they moved forward in that play.

Input Format:
An integer value that represents the number of yards gained or lost by your team.

A string of the appropriate cheer.
