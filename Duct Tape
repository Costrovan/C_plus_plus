/*
You want to completely cover a flat door on both sides with duct tape. You need to know how many rolls of duct tape to buy when you go to the store.

TASK:
Given the height and width of the door, determine how many rolls of duct tape you will need (a roll of duct taope is 60 feet long and 2 inches wide and there are 12 inches
in each food). Don't forget both sides of the door!

Input FORMAT:
Two integers that represent the height and width of the door.

Output FORMAT:
An integer that represents the total rolls of duct tape that you need to buy.

SAMPLE INPUT:
7
4

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
6 rolls

Explanation:
You will need 6 rolls of duct tape to cover both sides of the 7ft x 4ft door.

/* We need the "cmath" library to use the ceil('ceiling') command in the program. Otherwise we would have to work a way around the function.
