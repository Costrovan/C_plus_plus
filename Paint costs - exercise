/*
You are getting ready to paint a piece of art. The canvas and brushes that you want to use will cost 40,00. Each color of paint that you buy is an additional 5,00. Determine
how much money you will need based on the number of colors that you want to buy if the tax at this story is 10%.

TASK:
Given the total number of colors of paint that you need, calculate and output the total cost of your project rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Input Format:
An integer that represents the number of colors that you want to purchase for your project.

Output Format:
A number that represents the cost of your purchase rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Sample Input: 10
Sample Output 99

Explanation: 
You need 50.00 to buy 10 colors of paint + 40.00 for the canvas and the brushes + 9.00 for the tax.
