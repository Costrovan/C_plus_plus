/*
You and three friends go to a baseball game and you offer to go to the concession stand for everyone. They each order one thing, and you do as well. Nachos and Pizza both cost
$6.00. A Cheeseburger meal costs $10. Water is $4.00 and Coke is $5.00. Tax is 7%.

Task:
Determine the total cost of ordering 4 items from the concession stand. If one of your friend's orders something that isn't on the menu, you will order a Coke for them instead.

Input Format:
You are given a string of the four items that you've been asked to order that are separated by spaces.

Output Format:
You will output a number of the total cost of the food and drinks.

Sample INPUT: 'Pizza Cheeseburger Water Popcorn'
Sample OUTPUT: 26.75

Explanation: 
Because Popcorn is not on the menu, this friend gets a coke which brings the subtotal to $25.00 and $26.75 with tax.
