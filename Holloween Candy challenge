You go trick or treating with a friend and all but three of the houses that you visit are giving out candy. One house that you visit is giving out toothbrushes and two hosues
are giving out dollar bills.

Task:
Given the input of the total number of houses that you visited, what is the percentage chance that one random item pulled from your bag is a dollar bill?

Input Format: 
An integer (>=3) representing the total number of houses that you visited.

Output Format:
A percentage value rounded up to the nearest whole number.

Sample Input: 4
Sample Output: 50

Explanation:
If you visited four houses, one would be candy, two would be dollars, and one would be a toothbrush. A 2 in 4 chance is: 50%

#include <iostream>
#include <math>
using namespace std;

int maint()
{
//declaring houses and values
  float houses, cash_percentage, bottom_line;
  cout << "Number of hosues: ";
  cin >> houses;
// We need at least 3 houses because 2 houses give money and one gives toothbrush.
  if(houses >= 3)
  {
    cash_percentage = 2 / houses;
    bottom_line = round(cash_percentage * 100);
    if (bottom_line <= 0)
    {
      cout << bottom_line + 1;
    }
    else
      cout << bottom_line;
  }

return 0;
}
