/*
You are playing a game at your local arcade, and you receive "1 ticket" from the machine for every "12 points"  that you score. You want to purchase a squirt gun with your
tickets. Given your score, and the price of the squirt gun (in tickets) are you able to buy it?

Task:
Evaluate whether or not you have scored high enough to earn enough tickets to purchase the squirt gun at the arcade.

Input Format:
The first input is an integer value that represents the points that you scored playing, and the second input is an integer value that represents the cost of the squirt gun (in tickets).

Output Format:
A string that says "Buy it!" if you will have enough tickets, or a string that says "Try again" if you will not.

SAMPLE INPUT: 500  40
SAMPLE OUTPUT: "Buy it!"

Explanation: 
By scoring 500 points, you will receive 41 tickets. (41,66666... but it's rounded up to 41), which is enough to buy the squirt gun which costs 40 tickets.
